# Mojfree.tk-Spam
Spam the phishing site http://mojfree.tk. IMPORTANT: Do not enter any legitimate credidentials there.

## Explanation:
http://mojfree.tk is a phishing site which has been spamming Hypixel chats. They mimic Mojang's login webpage to make it seem like you are inputting your Minecraft credidentials into a valid site, and promise you a free Minecon cape if you do so. **Do not enter your personal Minecraft credidentials into this site.** It collects accounts and sells them on. If you play Hypixel Skyblock, you will most likely lose all of your coins. Your account will most likely get banned, or in the worst case, taken over completely.

## How does this help?
It used to be the case that crackers could use a **credidential stuffing** method to obtain other people's Minecraft accounts. Recently, Mojang has improved their security, and as far as I know, it is almost impossible to use this method now. Hackers are resorting to other tactics, like this one. If we fill their database with a load of nonsense, how are they going to know which accounts are legitimate and which ones aren't? Hopefully this will make it a lot harder for them, if not, impossible.

## To use:
(Optional but highly recommended) - Use a VPN to protect yourself whilst running this program.
1. Download the .jar file **or** compile it yourself.
2. Open Windows Explorer
3. Shift + Right Click
4. Press "Open PowerShell window here"
5. Type 'java -jar Spam.jar'
6. Run it for as long as you want. Closing the terminal will stop the program from running.

**IMPORTANT**: This program has no graphical interface. Opening it directly, without using a terminal, will keep the program running in the background forever, until you end the task in Task Manager. For the best control over the program, just open it in a terminal.
